# Description

 - I need a messaging system that doesn't use the Internet. 
 - A message has a recipient, a sender, and message text. 
 - A mailbox can store messages. 
 - Each user has at least 2 mailboxes: sent and received. 
 - The user needs to be able to log in, send messages to other users, read their own messages, log out.
